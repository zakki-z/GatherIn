# Distributed Real-Time Chat Application (Learning Project)

> **Note:** Before diving any further on this repo, please note that you may find a lot of unnecessary concepts that do not 100% match or suit the idea. This project is purely for **educational purposes and personal learning**.

## Overview

This project is a **learning-oriented chat application** designed to explore modern software architecture and backend concepts.  
It is **not intended for production or commercial use**, but as a hands-on learning experience for building a scalable, modular, and real-time system.

## Key Concepts & Goals

- **Microservices Architecture**: Split the system into independent services for Identity, Messaging, Groups, Notifications, and Realtime.
- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**: Model the system around core business domains and aggregates.
- **Event-Driven Communication**: Use Kafka for async events between services.
- **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)**: Separate write and read operations for performance and scalability.
- **Real-Time Messaging**: Deliver messages instantly using WebSockets.
- **Cloud & DevOps Learning**: Deploy using Docker, Kubernetes, and AWS EC2/API Gateway.
- **Frontend**: A simple web client built with Next.js for sending and receiving messages.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand and implement DDD tactical patterns
- Build and integrate multiple microservices
- Apply event-driven architecture and messaging
- Experiment with real-time communication and WebSockets
- Practice containerization, orchestration, and cloud deployment

## Status

- Project **started as a simple prototype**, but is continuously being updated to explore **scalability, modularity, and modern architectural concepts**.

## Tech Stack (planned)

- Backend: Spring Boot
- Frontend: Next.js
- Databases: PostgreSQL, MongoDB
- Cache & Pub/Sub: Redis
- Messaging/Event Bus: Kafka
- Deployment: Docker, Kubernetes, AWS EC2, AWS API Gateway
- Communication: REST APIs + WebSockets
